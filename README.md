# Cropshare

I was bored during quarantine, so I'm doing the senior design project over summer

Using Node.js + Express, ejs, bootstrap

## Libraries:
npm install ejs http-errors express path cookie-parser morgan body-parser

## To run:
- node bin/www
- "Express server listening on port 8080"
- go to: localhost:8080 'or' 127.0.0.1:8080
